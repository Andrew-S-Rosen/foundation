# Highlighting MP-Adjacent Software

## Context and Problem Statement

There are several software packages that use or are built around the core Materials Project software stack. An incomplete list can be found in the Pymatgen docs [here](https://pymatgen.org/addons#external-tools), which includes the ones that rely on Pymatgen in particular.

The aim of this decision is to decide where and how MP-adjacent software will be highlighted with the main goals being:

1. Increasing visibility of MP-adjacent software
2. Preventing the development of redundant software
3. Advertising the impact of the Materials Project ecosystem

## Decision Drivers

- Should be somewhere "central" with high visibility
- Should be easy to update from potential developers
- Should have some set of criteria for inclusion/exclusion

## Considered Options

- A dedicated page on the Materials Project website
- An "awesome list"-style GitHub repo under the Materials Project github account
