# Materials Project Decision Records

This repository contains records of decisions made by the Materials Project Software Foundation. Decisions are made available in [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format, and contain a *brief* summary of a decision, its context and the various options considered. It is hoped that making these decisions publicly available will reinforce the Materials Project's commitment to transparency, and provide useful information to those hoping to get involved in the project.
